# AWS Flashcard App with AWS Translate

## Overview

This is a simple serverless web application that enables users to create and manage flashcards for learning concepts. Each flashcard is automatically translated into a user-selected language using AWS Translate. The app leverages AWS serverless technologies to provide a scalable, low-maintenance learning tool.

### Deployment Steps

1. Clone the repository  
2. Configure AWS CLI with your credentials and default region  
3. Deploy backend Lambda functions and API Gateway (via SAM or manual setup)  
4. Create DynamoDB table for flashcards  
5. Deploy frontend to S3 and configure CloudFront distribution  
6. (Optional) Configure SES and EventBridge for email reminders  
7. Use the frontend to create and review flashcards

| GET    | /flashcards         | List all flashcards           |
| GET    | /flashcards/{id}    | Retrieve specific flashcard   |
| PUT    | /flashcards/{id}    | Update flashcard              |
| DELETE | /flashcards/{id}    | Delete flashcard              |

## Future Enhancements

- User authentication and multi-user support via AWS Cognito  
- Flashcard tagging and categories  
- Spaced repetition algorithm for optimized review scheduling  
- Mobile-friendly frontend or Progressive Web App (PWA)  
- Enhanced analytics and usage reporting  

---

## Security Considerations

- Use IAM roles with least privilege for Lambda functions  
- Secure API Gateway with appropriate authorization mechanisms  
- Store AWS credentials securely and rotate regularly  
- (If implementing user auth) Use AWS Cognito or other secure identity providers
